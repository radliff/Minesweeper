# Minesweeper

## Project Overview

This project is a classic implementation of the Minesweeper game, developed using C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with the help of clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

## Features

- **Customizable Grid**: Users can select the size of the grid and the number of mines.
- **User Interface**: Built with SFML, providing a graphical interface for interacting with the game.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click to reveal cells, flag potential mines, and check for victory.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamic updates to the game state based on user actions.
- **Game States**: Win or lose detection with corresponding messages.
